- Authors: Luan Tran, Xi Yin, Xiaoming Liu
- CVPR2017: http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/pdfs/Tran_Yin_Liu_CVPR2017.pdf
- Pytorch implimentation of DR-GAN (updated version in "Representation Learning by Rotating Your Faces")
- Added a pretrained ResNet18 to offer a feature loss in order to improve Generator's performance. (Only in Multi_DRGAN)

## Requirements
- python 3.6
- pytorch 0.2
- torchvision
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- tensorboardX

## How to use

### Install Enviroment
1. Install Anaconda with Python 3.6
[Installing Anaconda and Python 3.6 in Mac/Windows](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1811/resources/getting-started/install-anaconda.html)

2. Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Single-Image DR-GAN

1. Modify model function at base_options.py to define single model.
    - Data needs to have ID and pose lables corresponds to each image.
    - If you don't have, default dataset is CFP_dataset. Modify dataroot function at base_options.py.


2. Run train.py to train models
      - Trained models and Loss_log will be saved at "checkpoints" by default. Generated
      pictures will be saved at "result".
      > python train.py
      - You can also use tensorboard to watch the loss graphs in real-time. (Install tensorboard before doing it.)
      > tensorboard --logdir=/home/zhangjunhao/logs (Or the address of dir 'logs' in your folder.）

3. Generate Image with arbitrary pose
      - Change the "save_path" in base_model.py.
      - Specify leaned model's filename by "--pretrained_G" option in base_options.py.
      - Generated images will be saved at specified result directory.
      > python test.py


### Multi-Image DR-GAN

1. Modify model function at base_options.py to define multi model.
    - Data needs to have ID and pose lables corresponds to each image.
    - If you don't have, default dataset is CFP_dataset. Modify dataroot function at base_options.py.


2. Run train.py to train models
      - Trained models and Loss_log will be saved at "checkpoints" by default. Generated
      pictures will be saved at "result".
      > python train.py
      - You can also use tensorboard to watch the loss graphs in real-time. (Install tensorboard before doing it.)   
      > tensorboard --logdir=/home/zhangjunhao/logs (Or the address of dir 'logs' in your folder.）

3. Generate Image with arbitrary pose
      - Change the "save_path" in base_model.py.
      - Specify leaned model's filename by "--pretrained_G" option in base_options.py.
      - Generated images will be saved at specified result directory.
      > python test.py
